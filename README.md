## COVID 19 Data Visualizaton

Since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic and large-scale coverage reporting in 2023, data regarding county-level data has been widely avaiable for the public.
The purpose of this repository is to highlight the impact this virus had on the United States, and compare its effects county by county.

This repository contains hundreds of thousands of entries provided by the New York Times, and was accessed via Google Dataset Search.
Coverage is from 1/21/2020 to 3/23/2023 when data regarding COVID-19 cases was no longer updated.

More information on the dataset and methodologies can be found [here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/rolling-averages), at the New York Times' repository.

Thanks!
